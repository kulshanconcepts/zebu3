# Zebu 3 - OS for Raspberry Pi

Zebu 3 is an operating system project for Raspberry Pi. It currently has no long-term objectives. The short-term objective is to learn how ARM works at the low level.

### The Author

My name is Tyrel. I write operating systems for fun. I also work for a major global enterprise software company. I have contributed to a couple open source projects as well.

### The History Behind the Name

Zebu 3 is the third operating system I have written.

The first one, Zebu, was an Intel IA-32 (x86) operating system, written in C and assembly. I named it Zebu because a zebu is a type of bovine, like a gnu!

It ran on a floppy disk, could run programs from command line and was fully multi-tasking. I started on it in March of 2006, on SourceForge. In 2007, I moved it to a private repository and continued work on it off and on through June 2009. I definitely learned a lot with that project.

Zebu 2 started shortly, in August 2009. It was a multi-tasking operating system for Intel 64 (and AMD64). Its kernel was written in C++. I learned more here, not just about 64-bit assembly and such, but also about VM86 mode (allows running of 16-bit code to use BIOS calls) and some of the internals of C++. I haven't worked on Zebu 2 since February 2012.
